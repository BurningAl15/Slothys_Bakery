    "introPhrase10": "Welcome to Slothy’s Bakery.",
    "introPhrase11": "My name is Slothy, and I’m the baker.",
    "introPhrase12": "Thank you for choosing Slothy’s Bakery to start working.",
    "introPhrase13": "Today I need your help with comparing pieces of cakes or desserts.",
    "introPhrase14": "So I would like to explain a little about the magic of comparing fractions.",
    "introPhrase15": "You can compare two fractions by checking their numerators and denominators.",
    "introPhrase16": "With this, you can determine which fraction is greater than, less than or equals to another, regardless of whether their denominators or numerators are equals.",
    "introPhrase17": "For this task, you need to analyze the denominator of the fractions to determine if they are comparable.",
    "introPhrase18": "I will give you an example.",
    "instruction1": "When we want to compare fractions, we must check denominators. If they are equal, then we check the numerator. If they are different, then we search for common denominators. Then we compare",
    "miniGameQ10": "Are their denominators comparable?",
    "miniGameQ11": "What fraction must we multiply the first fraction by in order to make the denominators comparable?",
    "miniGameQ12": "What is the correct comparation sign?",
    "congratPhrase10": "Great work!",
    "congratPhrase11": "As you could see, we can't compare directly 1/2 and 3/4, so we must multiply 1/2 with 2/2 (or a fraction equal to 1), changing the fraction to 2/4.",
    "congratPhrase12": "The fractions 2/4 and 3/4 have the same denominators so they can be compared directly by comparing their numerators.",
    "congratPhrase13": "Let's practice a little more!",
    "endPhrase10": "Amazing job!",
    "endPhrase11": "This is the first step to compare fractions, we must check if their denominators can be compared or equal.",
    "endPhrase12": "If they can't be compared, we must multiply them to get a fraction with a comparable denominator.",
    "endPhrase13": "For the next step, we can compare numerators and have a result that can be greater, less or equals.",
    "introPhrase20": "For the next step, I need your help with some orders.",
    "introPhrase21": "As we saw in the first task, we must follow some steps to compare fractions.",
    "introPhrase22": "Check their denominators to find if they are directly comparable.",
    "introPhrase23": "If they are equal, the numerators will determine which is greater and which is less than the other.",
    "introPhrase24": "If they are not equal, we must multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction with a value.",
    "introPhrase25": "So the fraction will be converted in a comparable fraction.",
    "introPhrase26": "In this task, we must follow this steps.",
    "introPhrase27": "Take a pen and a piece of paper and convert the fractions if is needed.",
    "introPhrase28": "Then drag and drop one of the signs <, > or = and press the button to check if we are right.",
    "introPhrase29": "Let's go to it!",
    "instruction2": "Drag correct the sign in the plate. Press the Check button to confirm.",
    "Q1": "What could be an Equivalent value for the pieces of bread shown?",
    "Q2": "What could be a Greater value than the pieces of dessert shown?",
    "Q3": "What could be a Less value than the pieces of dessert shown?",
    "Q4": "What could be a Greater value than the pieces of dessert shown?",
    "Q5": "What could be a Less value than the pieces of dessert shown?",
    "Q6": "What could be an Equivalent value for the pieces of bread shown?",
    "congratPhrase20": "WOW! Amazing skills!",
    "congratPhrase21": "The greater piece was 1/3.",
    "congratPhrase22": "As you can see, the 1/3 have bigger pieces.",
    "congratPhrase23": "Let's continue comparing fractions!",
    "endPhrase20": "Excellent job!",
    "endPhrase21": "You followed the steps perfectly and almost mastered fraction comparing.",
    "endPhrase22": "Thank you for helping me with this task.",
    "introPhrase30": "Good work! You are almost an expert analyzing fractions of desserts and cakes.",
    "introPhrase31": "Thank you for helping me with the first two tasks.",
    "introPhrase32": "For this step, we will do a final check to the orders that will be delivered so you must pay attention to the questions so we can confirm the order is fine.",
    "introPhrase33": "Let’s put your skills in test once more.",
    "instruction3": "Answer by writing the correct fraction. Press the submit button.",
    "congratPhrase30": "Incredible!",
    "congratPhrase31": "You are correct!",
    "congratPhrase32": "If we want to have a better understanding we check their denominators and find that they are not comparable.",
    "congratPhrase33": "We convert 1/2 to a comparable fraction by multiplying it with a number in the denominator and numerator.",
    "congratPhrase34": "That's how we got a fraction that is equals to 1/2",
    "congratPhrase35": "Let's continue.",
    "endPhrase30": "What a wonderful job!",
    "endPhrase31": "Now that you showed your skills by comparing all this fractions, I'm impressed with your knowledge.",
    "endPhrase32": "I feel you deserve to become my star assistant for now on.",
    "final0": "I am very impressed with the knowledge you showed helping with all those tasks.",
    "final1": "And I think you proved how incredible you are with fraction comparations, you deserve recognition.",
    "final2": "So I give you this. Congratulations!"
